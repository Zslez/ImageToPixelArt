## Description

Simple and fast tool to scale down images and make them look like Pixel Art.
It also has a very simple border detection algorithm that allows you to add a border to the image.

It has still few features as it's a new project, and has also a very simple GUI, so I'll appreciate any [contribution](#contribute) or suggestion for this project.

## How to use

Just copy the `main.py` file.  
If you want to use the same theme and font I used, download the [Tkinter Theme](#tkinter-theme-used) and the [Font](#font-used), otherwise you can remove or comment out the following lines from `main.py`:

- to remove the **theme**:
  - from [63](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#L63) to [66](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#L66)
  - [127](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#L127)
  - [128](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#L128)
- to remove the **font**:
  - [61](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#L61)
  - [134](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/blob/master/main.py#134)

## Contribute

---

**ANY CONTRIBUTION WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED**... really, **any**

---

If you want to contribute I can reccomend taking a look at open [issues](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/issues), if there are any.

Also I'd really like it if you could improve the GUI, I'm not really creative to be honest.

Anyway, you can always **[suggest new features](https://github.com/Zslez/Zslez#-how-to-reach-me)** or directly **[open pull requests](https://github.com/Zslez/ImageToPixelArt/compare)** if you already have one, **fix typos**, **speed up algorithms** and literally **anything else** that will somehow improve the code.

Otherwise, if you really want to contribute but you don't know how, you can
